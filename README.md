# sEMG_FORCE-Prediction
This work was done to train a MLP model to predict grasping forces from recorded sEMG data was distributed as a 3 bracelet of sEMG electrodes, each of 8 channels 
(=24 EMG channels), as the model input after filtering using butterworth and notch filters. The output is a 10 predicted grasping forces (2 for each figer).
More deatails will be supplied soon.
The work is still in progress
